## Implementation Journals

- [Batch 2: Communication & Notifications (2026-03-08)](../journal/2026-03-08-adr-api-audit-batch-2.md)
- [Batches 3 & 4: Data & Storage + Features & Integrations (2026-03-08)](../journal/2026-03-08-adr-api-audit-batches-3-4.md)

## How to Audit

For each ADR:
1. Read the ADR's Decision/Architecture sections
2. Cross-reference against `backend/routes/api.php` and relevant controllers/services
3. Cross-reference against `docs/api/README.md` and `docs/api/openapi.yaml`
4. Check frontend integration where ADR describes UI
5. Record findings in the table below

**Legend**: ✅ Matches | ⚠️ Partial/minor issues | ❌ Missing or significantly wrong

## Batch 1: Auth & Identity

| ADR | Title | Docs Accuracy | ADR Alignment | Implementation Complete | Notes |
|-----|-------|--------------|---------------|------------------------|-------|
| 002 | Authentication Architecture | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | All endpoints, rate limiting, session auth correct |
| 003 | SSO Provider Integration | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | 5 endpoints missing from OpenAPI. `linkedAccounts()` was unrouted — fixed |
| 004 | Two-Factor Authentication | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | Recovery code endpoints missing from OpenAPI. 2FA verify schema had `recovery_code` instead of `is_recovery_code` — fixed |
| 012 | Admin-Only Settings Access | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | All settings routes use `can:settings.view/edit` middleware |
| 015 | Env-Only Settings | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | APP_KEY, DB_*, LOG_* correctly excluded from SettingService |
| 018 | Passkey/WebAuthn | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | Passkey login used generic `throttle:10,1` instead of `rate.sensitive` — fixed. OpenAPI passkey ID type was integer instead of string — fixed |
| 020 | User Groups & Permissions | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 13 permissions, GroupService/PermissionService with caching, all routes permission-gated |

| 005 | Notification System Architecture | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ | 2 missing endpoints in README, 3 OpenAPI schema errors (Notification.id type, mark-read body field/type), ~15 endpoints missing from docs — all fixed. ADR model schema stale (body→message, channels_sent removed), ntfy missing from channel table, orchestrator signature outdated — all fixed |
| 016 | Email Template System | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | All 6 endpoints documented in both README and OpenAPI. 4 default templates match seeder. Fully aligned |
| 017 | Notification Template System | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ | 5 endpoints missing from README — fixed. OpenAPI had all 5. ADR seeder list outdated (6 types → 14 types, 3 channel groups → 4) — fixed |
| 025 | Novu Notification Integration | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | 7 endpoints (1 user + 6 admin) missing from both README and OpenAPI — all fixed |

## Cross-Cutting Checks

After all batches, verify these global concerns:

- [ ] All 240 routes in `api.php` are documented in `README.md`
- [ ] All endpoints in `openapi.yaml` actually exist in `api.php`
- [ ] No orphaned endpoints (in code but not docs, or in docs but not code)
- [ ] Rate limiting documented matches middleware applied
- [ ] Permission/middleware requirements match docs
- [ ] Error response schemas in OpenAPI match actual error responses
